# File Generator
Generate large text files with dummy data (i.e. for performance testing an app that needs to read a file). 

This is a console app. It allows to generate large files (you can specify the size in megabytes). 

It has a dictionary of english words (source: https://github.com/dwyl/english-words) which you can replace with your own set. They are picked at random, the generated phrases don't make up meaningful sentences. They repeat occasionally (you can specify the rate at which it happens).
